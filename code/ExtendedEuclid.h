// Use Euclid Extended to find the solution of equation ax + by = gcd (a, b).
// Assuming the result is (x0, y0), the solution family of the equation will be (x_0 + kb / d, y_0-ka / d) with kâˆˆZ.
// General equation ax + by = d only has solutions when d is divisible by gcd (a, b).
// a x + b y = gcd(a, b)
